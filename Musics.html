<center><Strong>Born John Francis Bongiovi Jr. on March 2, 1962, in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, Jon Bon Jovi knew in his early teens that he wanted to be a rock star
. He formed the band Bon Jovi in the 1980s, which became popular for its power ballads, soaring guitar riffs, and well-crafted melodies.
 Jon Bon Jovi has also acted in such films as The Leading Man and was a recurring character on TV's Ally McBeal.
 Today he continues to perform with his legendary band Bon Jovi. Their recent albums include What About Now (2013) and Burning Bridges (2015).
 Their self-titled debut came out on January 21, 1984. Filled with the group's now-signature power ballads underscored by soaring guitar riffs and 
 well-crafted melodies, the album went gold. Bon Jovi released its follow-up album, 7800 Fahrenheit, in April 1985, which was popular with the fans,
 but less so with the press. Many critics were turned off by the hard-rock band's manicured image and formulaic style. </Strong>

<center><Strong>The seeds of what would become the rap-rock sensation Linkin Park were sown in Southern California in 1996 when three high school friends—drummer Rob Bourdon, guitarist Brad Delson, and vocalist Mike Shinoda—decided to form a band. Soon after graduation, they completed their lineup by recruiting three more members: bassist Dave Farrell, turntablist Joe Hahn, and temporary lead singer Mark Wakefield. 
Calling themselves first SuperXero and then simply Xero, the group began recording demos but failed to garner much interest in their songs.</Strong>

<center><Strong>As Danny Elfman was growing up in the Los Angeles area, he was largely unaware of his talent for composing. 
It wasn't until the early 1970s that Danny and his older brother Richard Elfman started a musical troupe while in Paris; the group 
"Mystic Knights of Oingo-Boingo" was created for Richard's directorial debut, Forbidden Zone (1980) (now considered a cult classic by Elfman fans). 
The group's name went through many incarnations over the years, beginning with "The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo" and eventually just Oingo Boingo. 
While continuing to compose eclectic, intelligent rock music for his L.A.-based band (some of which had been used in various film soundtracks.Song Played in Movie Spider-Man 2</strong>

<center><Strong>Austin Richard Post (born July 4, 1995), known professionally as Post Malone, is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, and record producer. Born in Syracuse, New York and raised in Grapevine, Texas, Malone began his hip hop career following the release of his debut single "White Iverson" in 2015.[7] It peaked at number 14 on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was later certified quadruple platinum in the United States; its success resulted in his recording contract with Republic Records later that year.[8]

Malone has since earned the number-four album Stoney (2016) and number-one album Beerbongs & Bentleys (2018) on the US Billboard 200. Beerbongs & Bentleys broke several streaming records upon release, while Stoney broke Michael Jackson's 34-year-old record for most weeks on Billboard's Top R&B and Hip-Hop Albums chart after reaching its 77th week compared to the 76 weeks that Thriller spent on the chart.[9] Further, Malone has attained six top-ten singles on the Billboard Hot 100: "Congratulations", "Better Now", “Wow” and the chart-topping songs "Rockstar", "Psycho", and "Sunflower" with Swae Lee.</Strong>
